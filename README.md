# Dependencies
Enhanced Stream Chat depends on [BSML](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage), and [StreamCore](https://github.com/brian91292/StreamCore/releases). Make sure to install them, or Enhanced Stream Chat won't work!
  
# Installation
Copy EnhancedStreamChat.dll to your Beat Saber\Plugins folder, and install all of its dependencies. That's it!

# Usage
All you need to enter is the channel name which you want to join (see the `Setup` section below), the chat will show up to your right in game, and you can move it by pointing at it with the laser from your controller and grabbing it with the trigger. You can also move the chat towards you and away from you by pressing up and down on the analog stick or trackpad on your controller. Finally, you can use the lock button in the corner of the chat to lock the chat position in place so you don't accidentally move it.

# Setup
Most common options can be configured directly via the Beat Saber settings menu in the Enhanced Stream Chat submenu, as seen in the image below.

# Config
To manually edit the config options, browse to `Beat Saber\UserData\StreamCore\EnhancedStreamChat.ini` file.  *Keep in mind all config options will update in realtime when you save the file! This means you don't have to restart the game to see your changes!* Use the tables below as a guide for setting these values:
